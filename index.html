            <p>Hugo</p>

                <p>Spotted dog with brown face and brown eyes with bunny ears, and a green collar</p>
                <p>Hugo is a very energetic and excitable dog just last week. He killed his first bunny rabbit in the backyard that shows the irony displayed in the picture</p>
                <p>Hugo is a very strong, but never realizes his strength when throwing paws at my face </p>
